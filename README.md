# The girls want to marry me - The arcade Game!

**The girl want to marry me** is and arcade game based on the udacity arcade game from the course *Front-End Developer*. 

Udacity provided the visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools I have added a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game **Frogger**. If you want to download the code provided by Udacity, you can check the following [link](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game)
